        <div className="about-text">Introducing HEART - the solution to bridging the gap between “non-creatives” and “creatives” and empowering inclusion among the UW community.</div>
        <div className="about-text">HEART is a platform that lowers the barrier of entry for anyone who wants to post and express their creative endeavors. Whether you're a seasoned artist or a beginner trying to explore your creativity, HEART welcomes you to share your work with the world.
        <p></p>
        But HEART is more than just an art gallery - it's a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about creativity and innovation. By sharing your work on HEART, you can connect with others who share your interests.

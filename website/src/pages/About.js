        <div className="about-header">Problem Overview:</div>
        <div className="about-text">Despite its importance, creativity is often overlooked in society. Creativity promotes innovative solutions to complex problems and celebrates creatives in a variety of creative mediums. But existing apps glorify creativity instead of highlighting the small successes in people’s creative approaches. Thus Heart makes creativity approachable, from beginners to seasoned artists.
